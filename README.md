Project for Week 4 of Codecademy course. Had a lot of difficulty with this---in particular the image wrapping in the middle of the site.
I have worked many hours on this, including going through entire courses online from some other resources, to understand these
concepts. Am later turning this in than I planned due to recent bout with Austin allergens. Was unable to get the black background
removed from the 'Locations' header near the bottom of the page.
